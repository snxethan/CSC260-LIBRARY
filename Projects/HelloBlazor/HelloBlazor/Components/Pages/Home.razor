	Hello! My name is Ethan Townsend, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Neumont College of Computer Science. I have a strong passion for software development and enjoy building both web and mobile applications. I'm especially interested in full-stack development, AI integration, and creating tools that make technology more accessible to everyone.

	In my free time, I love exploring new tech frameworks, working on personal projects, and contributing to group assignments where I can bring creativity and structure to the team. I’m also a fan of fitness, gaming, and digital design. My goal is to continuously grow as a developer and eventually work at a leading tech company like Google.
